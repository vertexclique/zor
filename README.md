# Zor

Benchmarking is difficult, "zor" creates a baseline for that.
Zor is for properly running Rust benchmarks. And it is a benchmark utility for cargo benchmarks.

Clone the repo and then:

```bash
$ sudo ./zor
```

If `cargo bench` is compiling wait for compilation to settle and then rerun `zor` and `cargo bench` afterwards.

# TODO

- [ ] Became a cargo plugin.
