# Zor

Benchmarking is difficult, "zor" creates a baseline for that.
Zor is a utility tool for benchmarking in Rust and it properly allows to run them.

Clone the repo and then:

```bash
$ sudo ./zor
```

If `cargo bench` is compiling wait for compilation to settle and then rerun `zor` and `cargo bench` afterwards.
